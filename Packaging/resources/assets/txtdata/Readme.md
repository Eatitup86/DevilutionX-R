Data files are based on the format used by Diablo 2. This is a format very
similar to [IANA TSV][iana-tsv] but with fewer restrictions. Existing tools
such as AFJ Sheet, Diablo 2 Excel File Editor, [D2ExcelPlus][d2-excel-plus],
or spreadsheet programs such as Excel and [LibreOffice][libreoffice] Calc can
be used to read/modify these files. If using a program like Excel or
LibreOffice you will need to check that the output matches the expected format
(tabs as delimiters, field values saved with leading spaces and quote
characters preserved, tabs and newlines in fields stripped or transformed to
spaces).

## Format Specification
For modders, the important thing to keep in mind is that values cannot contain
tab characters or line breaks. If you make sure the file looks roughly the
same after changing your values you shouldn't get any errors.

A formal description of the format using
[W3C's EBNF for XML notation][w3-xml-ebnf]:
```
/*
  Files MAY start with a UTF8 BOM (mainly to play nicer with Excel).
  The first record in a file SHOULD be used as a header
    Implementations are free to treat records however they want, using
    multiple records as headers or none at all.
  Files SHOULD contain at least one record.
    An empty file (zero-length or containing only a UTF8 BOM sequence) is
    valid and is typically interpreted as a header for a single unnamed column
    with no records.
  Records SHOULD contain the same number of fields.
  Files SHOULD end with a trailing newline.
    Note that while a trailing newline is treated as if the file has a final
    record containing a single empty field, in practice these records SHOULD
    be discarded. This is mainly to handle the typical output from spreadsheet
    applications like Excel.
*/
DXTxtFile ::= utf8bom? header ( recordsep, record )*

utf8bom   ::= #xEF #xBB #xBF

header    ::= record

/* an empty line is treated as a single empty field */
record    ::= field ( fieldsep field )*

/* fields MAY be zero length */
field     ::= character*

/*
  Any Char (see https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#NT-Char) except Tab ("\t", 0x09),
  Line Feed ("\n", 0x0A), or Carriage Return ("\r", 0x0D) is allowed as a
  field value. For maximum portability characters in the discouraged ranges
  described in the linked section SHOULD NOT be used
*/
character ::= [^#x9#xA#xD]

/* fields MUST be separated by tabs */
fieldsep  ::= #x9

/* records MUST be separated by line feeds, a cr/lf pair MAY be used */
recordsep ::= #xD? #xA
```

## File Descriptions
The following documentation describes how these files are used in DevilutionX.
Diablo and Hellfire do not use external text files, you cannot use these files
to change the behaviour in the original games or the GoG versions. Diablo 2
uses a similar but distinct format, [ThePhrozenKeep][d2mods-info] provide a
good reference for modding that game. Diablo 2 Resurrected uses a different
format again, refer to the help files provided alongside the game data
(`Data/Global/Excel`) (also available online at
[D2:R Modding][d2rmodding-utilities]).

### Experience.txt
Experience contains the experience value thresholds before a character
advances to the next level. All numeric values in this file MUST be written in
base 10 with no decimal or thousands separators. The first row of this file is
used as a header and requires the following column names:

#### Level
A numeric value used to set the order for remaining values, or the special
`MaxLevel` value which is used to determine the maximum character level. At
the moment you must ensure that the header line is the first line in the file,
the `MaxLevel` line is second, and levels proceed in ascending order after
that. Currently Level values other than `MaxLevel` are ignored (we start from
0 and count up for the rest of the rows) but this may change in the future.

For example you could set a maximum level of 36 by changing the MaxLevel value:
```tsv
Level	Experience
MaxLevel	36
0	0
1	2000
...
```

The first row following the `MaxLevel` line SHOULD be `0	0` (as all characters
start at level 1, we ignore this row and use the second row to determine when
characters advance past level 1). There SHOULD also be at least as many rows
following that line as the highest value provided for `MaxLevel`. If you
specify a `MaxLevel` of `60` but only provide experience values up to `50`
then characters will not be able to advance past level 50.

#### Experience
This column determines the experience points required for characters to
advance past that level. For example a file like:
```tsv
Level	Experience
MaxLevel	5
0	0
1	2000
2	4000
3	6000
4	8000
5	10000
```
Could be used to have characters level up to a max of 5 every 2000 experience
points. They would start at level 1, level up to 2 at 2000 exp, level 3 at
4000 exp, level 4 at 6000 exp, then reach the maxium level of 5 at 8000 exp.
Characters would continue gaining experience until they hit 10000 experience
points and will not level up any further.

You should provide a value for every row up to (and including) the maximum
level you intend players to be able to reach. If you have an empty cell for an
experience value at a row earlier than the `MaxLevel` value then characters
will not be able to advance past that level. They will continue to gain
experience without a cap (up to the hard limit of `2^32-1`, 4,294,967,295).
