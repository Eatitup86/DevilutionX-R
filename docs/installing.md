# Installing

First, you will need access to the game MPQ files.
- First, locate `DIABDAT.MPQ` on your CD or in the GoG installation (or [extract it from the GoG installer](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/wiki/Extracting-the-.MPQs-from-the-GoG-installer)).
- For the Diablo: Hellfire expansion you will also need `hellfire.mpq`, `hfmonk.mpq`, `hfmusic.mpq`, `hfvoice.mpq`.
- Lastly, DevilutionX comes with [devilutionx.mpq](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/raw/master/Packaging/resources/devilutionx.mpq) which you will also need.

Download the latest [DevilutionX release](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/releases) for your system (if available) and extract the contents to a location of your choosing, or [build from source](building.md). Then follow the system-specific instructions below.

- Copy the MPQ files to the folder containing the DevilutionX exe, or to the data folder. The data folder path may differ, but will normally be `%AppData%\diasurgical\devilution`
- Run `devilutionx.exe`
